# auth-graphql-starter

Starter project from a GraphQL course on Udemy.com - Section 3!
As a small improvement, i added a Snackbar that can be triggered from anywhere via showSnackbar(message, type).

### Setup

- Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the root of the project to install dependencies
- Access the application at `localhost:4000` in your browser
