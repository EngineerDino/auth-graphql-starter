# auth-graphql-starter

Starter project from a GraphQL course on Udemy.com.

In order to take things from the course a little bit further, 2 additional features have been implemented:
1. This Project has been merged with the Project Nr. 2 from the same course ("lyrical-graphql").
If you are logged in, you can access the functionality of said Project Nr. 2 (add Songs, Lyrics and like Lyrics).

2. As a small improvement, i added a Snackbar that can be triggered from anywhere via showSnackbar(message, type).

### Setup

- Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the root of the project to install dependencies
- Access the application at `localhost:4000` in your browser
